# Game Background Music

This directory contains a collection of original background music pieces composed by Claude AI for various game genres. The pieces are written in ABC notation and include a melody staff, a left-hand piano staff, and a string instrument staff to provide a rich and immersive musical experience.

## Pieces

1. **Mysterious/Eerie**: A haunting and suspenseful piece perfect for mystery, horror, or thriller games.
2. **Upbeat/Adventurous**: An energetic and exciting piece suitable for action, adventure, or platformer games.
3. **Serene/Peaceful**: A calm and relaxing piece ideal for exploration, puzzle, or casual games.
4. **Epic/Cinematic**: A grand and dramatic piece fitting for RPGs, strategy, or story-driven games.

## Prompts

* Help me create some interesting game background music using ABC notation
* Really cool, could you enrich them by adding a left hand staff and a string instrument staff?
* Could you make them longer, with repeating with some variations
