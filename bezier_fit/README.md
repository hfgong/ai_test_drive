# Fit functions with Bezier curves

# Prompt list:

* Write code to fit a sine wave and an exp function with Bezier curves, plot the original and the fitted values in two subplots, make sure it works in Google colab
* Extend the sine wave to be from -2pi to 2pi, use Bezier with more vertices, print the Bezier parameters
* Add some comments in bezier_curve() explaining the parameters unpacking, and the convention you used for the bezier curve, as there are many conventions about the bezier vertices and control points and their order.
* Also demonstrate exp fitting with some negative range, together with sine wave, keep the comments, draw in sub figures
