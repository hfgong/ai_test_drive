# CNC Machining Program for iPhone-like Phone Case

This project contains a CNC machining program written in G-code to create a rounded rectangle phone case similar to an iPhone from a solid block of material. The material block dimensions are 160 x 80 x 80 mm, and the program hollows out the material, leaving a 2mm outer wall. The program also ensures that the outer wall's rounded corners are machined.

## Prompt

* Using CNC machine programming, create an iPhone-like rounded rectangle phone case from a solid block of material with dimensions 160 x 80 x 80 mm. Hollow out the material with the machine, leaving a 2mm outer wall. Ensure that the outer wall's rounded corners are also machined.


## Simulate G-code with NC Viewer

You can use the free online tool [NC Viewer](https://ncviewer.com/) to simulate and visualize the G-code before running it on your CNC machine. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [NC Viewer](https://ncviewer.com/).
2. Open the `phone_case_gcode.nc` file by clicking on the "Open" button or drag and drop the file into the NC Viewer window.
3. Use the controls to visualize and verify the toolpath.
