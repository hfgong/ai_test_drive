\section{Introduction}
This document describes a self-contained algorithm for solving linear systems of the form \(Ax = b\) using a robust variant of Cramer's rule. The algorithm is designed to handle both overdetermined and underdetermined systems by using the least squares method and minimal norm solution, respectively. Additionally, it includes a stabilization technique that adds a small multiple of the identity matrix \(\epsilon I\) to ensure numerical stability.

\section{Cramer's Rule}
Cramer's rule provides a solution to a system of linear equations when the number of equations is equal to the number of unknowns. For a 3x3 system:

\[
\begin{cases}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = b_2 \\
a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = b_3
\end{cases}
\]

The solution is given by:

\[
x_i = \frac{\Delta_i}{\Delta}
\]

where \(\Delta\) is the determinant of matrix \(A\):

\[
\Delta = \begin{vmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{vmatrix}
\]

and \(\Delta_i\) is the determinant of matrix \(A\) with the \(i\)-th column replaced by \(b\):

\[
\Delta_1 = \begin{vmatrix}
b_1 & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
b_2 & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
b_3 & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{vmatrix}
\]

\[
\Delta_2 = \begin{vmatrix}
a_{11} & b_1 & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & b_2 & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & b_3 & a_{33}
\end{vmatrix}
\]

\[
\Delta_3 = \begin{vmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & b_1 \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & b_2 \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & b_3
\end{vmatrix}
\]

\section{Least Squares Solution for Overdetermined Systems}
For overdetermined systems (\(N > 3\)), we use the least squares method, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE):

\[
x = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b
\]

To ensure numerical stability, especially when \(A^T A\) is nearly singular, we add \(\epsilon I\) to \(A^T A\):

\[
x = (A^T A + \epsilon I)^{-1} A^T b
\]

\section{Minimal Norm Solution for Underdetermined Systems}
For underdetermined systems (\(N < 3\)), we augment the matrix \(A\) to make it square by adding rows of zeros and augment the vector \(b\) by adding zeros. Then, we solve the resulting system using the same method as for the overdetermined case.

\section{Algorithm Description}
The unified algorithm can be described as follows:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Robust Cramer Solver}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 3}$, Vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$, Scalar $\epsilon$
\ENSURE Vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$
\IF{$N < 3$}
    \STATE Augment $A$ with $(3-N)$ rows of zeros
    \STATE Augment $b$ with $(3-N)$ zeros
\ENDIF
\STATE Compute $A^T A$
\STATE Add $\epsilon I$ to $A^T A$
\STATE Compute $A^T b$
\STATE Solve $(A^T A + \epsilon I)x = A^T b$ using Cramer's Rule
\RETURN $x$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
