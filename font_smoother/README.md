# Font Path Smoothing

This project demonstrates how to smooth the font paths of TrueType or OpenType fonts using Python. It utilizes the Fourier transform to remove high-frequency components from the font path, resulting in smoother curves.

## Features

- Downloads a font file (e.g., Roboto) from the Google Fonts repository
- Extracts the font path coordinates for specific glyphs
- Separates the outline and holes of each glyph
- Applies Fourier transform to smooth the font paths
- Plots the original and smoothened paths for comparison

## Usage
- Download the font file from `https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/apache/roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf`.
- You might need to install the fonttools package, run `pip install fonttools`.

## Prompts
* I would like to manipulate a TTF font file, to make the font path smoother.  Please help me write Python code to download a Google font (e.g., Roboto), extract its font paths, reparameterize to arc length parameter, for x, and y, do Fourier transform with respect to arc length, finally drop the high frequency components and transform back into the curve domain to get a smoother font path.  Draw the original path and smoothened paths in matplotlib figure.
* The outline and holes are joined into one path, this is not what I want, they need to be processed separately.
* Make the smoother a function, run for glyph A, B and C, draw them in one figure, separate axes
