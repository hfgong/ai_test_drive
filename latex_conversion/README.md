# Plain text to Latex document conversion

## Introduction

This directory contains Latext documents converted from plain texts.  There are two demos, 1) creating a outline document with sections extracted from plain text TOC, 2) converting a plain text form to Latex for potential richer typesetting.

The Latex documents are converted using GPT-4o.

## Prompt

### Generate \LaTex Sections based on TOC

Help me clean up the following table of contents.
Please remove page numbers, section numbers and organize them into Latex sections and subsections.
