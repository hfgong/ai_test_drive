# Solving a Differential Equation with SymPy and LaTeX

This repository contains a demonstration of solving the differential equation \( y'' + y' + y + t = 0 \) using SymPy in Python and presenting the solution in a LaTeX document. Both Python and Latex code is generated using ChatGPT (GPT-4o).

## Files

- `demo_ode.py`: A Python script that uses SymPy to solve the differential equation.
- `demo_ode.tex`: A LaTeX document that presents the problem and the solution.

## Promtps
* Help me write Python sympy code to solve y'' + y'+y +t=0
* Help me write code to verify the solution
* After running the code, the solution is Eq(y(t), -t + `(C1*sin(sqrt(3)*t/2) + C2*cos(sqrt(3)*t/2))*exp(-t/2) + 1)`, could you put the problem and solution into a latex document?
